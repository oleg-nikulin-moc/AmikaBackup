  2020.12.04 Update
  Keep banners below category pages and remove Automat chat inside. 
  Automat SDK, which installed on theme.liquid, inject existing banner and inject CTA button and chat inside.
  The reason, not inject whole banner through SDK, is showing banner through shopify is faster to load, better for UX.

  To add Banner chat to Collection pages, include the exact title of the page in
  the array below, separted from the others by a double pipe ( || )

  PLEASE NOTE: Arrays must be initialized by splitting a string, so the spaces and the pipes
  are important.

  Refer to https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/types/#initializing-arrays
